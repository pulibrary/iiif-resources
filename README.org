* IIIF Resources
This Python 3 library models the Resources defined in the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF).  It requires Python 3.11 or higher.

It is being developed primarily for use with the PUL Digital Repository (Figgy), and because Figgy's resources are overwhelmingly Manifests the conform with version 2 of the IIIF Presentation API, this early implementation focuses on that version.  However the library is being designed to support different versions of the IIIF Framework.
